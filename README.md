# BCG Data Science Job Simulation  

**BCGX_DataScience:** <br>
Completed BCG's Data Science job simulation on Forage, where I analyzed customer churn data using Python (pandas, NumPy). Built and optimized a Random Forest model with 85% accuracy, visualized trends, and created an executive summary for actionable insights. Gained hands-on experience in EDA, machine learning, and client communication.

**Repository Overview:**  
This repository highlights my experience in customer churn analysis, completed during the BCG Data Science job simulation on the Forage platform. As part of this simulation, I worked on analyzing customer data to predict churn and deliver actionable insights. This project allowed me to apply advanced data science techniques, including data analysis with Python, model building, and creating an executive summary to communicate findings to key stakeholders.

**Simulation Highlights:**

1. **Customer Churn Analysis**  
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors contributing to customer churn.
   - Utilized Python (pandas, NumPy) for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

2. **Random Forest Model Optimization**  
   - Engineered and optimized a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn, achieving an accuracy rate of 85%.
   - Applied model evaluation techniques to ensure the robustness of the model.

3. **Data Visualization & Insights**  
   - Created clear and informative data visualizations to highlight trends and patterns in customer behavior.
   - Developed an executive summary for the Associate Director, providing actionable insights to support business decision-making.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- **Business Understanding & Client Communication**: Synthesized business problems into data science solutions and communicated findings clearly.  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Conducted EDA, data manipulation, and visualized trends using Python libraries.  
- **Mathematical Modeling & Machine Learning**: Built and optimized a Random Forest model to predict customer churn.  
- **Hypothesis Framing & Model Evaluation**: Applied hypothesis-driven approaches to the data and evaluated model performance.  
- **Programming**: Proficient in Python, using pandas and NumPy for data analysis.

**Skills Developed:**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Model Interpretation & Evaluation**  
- **Data Visualization**  
- **Business Communication & Executive Reporting**  
- **Machine Learning (Random Forest)**  
- **Synthesis & Decision Making**

**Objective:**  
This repository showcases my growth in applying data science techniques to real-world business problems, with a focus on customer churn prediction and clear communication of insights. I am eager to apply these skills in a data science team at a leading consulting firm like BCG, where I can contribute to solving complex business challenges.
